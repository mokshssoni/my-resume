            Dear Hiring Committee,
            <br><br>
            Short Version:
            <br>
            I have over five years of experience in program evaluation, data modeling, and business intelligence. I specialize in transforming complex datasets into actionable insights through automated reporting, statistical analysis, and data visualization. My expertise in Excel, SQL, Tableau, and SPSS—combined with my ability to communicate findings effectively—allows me to support strategic decision-making. I am confident that my skills and experience will add immense value to UBC’s Faculty of Medicine.
            <br><br>
            Long Version:
            <br>
            Throughout my career, I have been dedicated to using data to drive meaningful insights and decision-making. At the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT), I designed and implemented automated reporting systems, reducing report generation time by 40% while ensuring accuracy for multi-million-dollar funding agreements. I collaborated with stakeholders to develop evaluation frameworks and KPIs, aligning measurement plans with institutional goals.
            <br><br>
            In my previous roles as a Market Research Analyst at SAIT, I conducted mixed-methods evaluations, combining qualitative thematic analysis with quantitative statistical methods. I created detailed reports and infographics that transformed complex information into accessible insights for leadership. My experience working with multiple stakeholders in dynamic environments has strengthened my ability to tailor evaluation methodologies to diverse needs.
            <br><br>
            Beyond my technical expertise, I am passionate about equity, diversity, and inclusion in education. UBC’s commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive learning environment strongly aligns with my values. I am eager to contribute my analytical skills and experience to support the Faculty of Medicine’s educational programs and decision-making processes.
            <br><br>
            I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can benefit your team. Thank you for your time and consideration.
            <br><br>
            Sincerely,
            <br>
            Moksh Soni
